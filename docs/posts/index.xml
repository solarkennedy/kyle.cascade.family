      <description>I want to share a tool I&amp;rsquo;ve been using to help track baby activities, an ESPHome-powered 10&amp;quot; eInk dashboard:
(Snapshot taken after opening up the windows right after a long nap. Click for a full size image.)
This dashboard is an Inkplate10, which is a upcycled Kindle DX display, retrofitted with an ESP32 for easy hackability.
There is a lot going on with this dashboard, let&amp;rsquo;s review the parts.
Dashboard Components Baby Data The baby data is fetched from the local MQTT broker and displayed in a human-friendly format.</description>

      <title>Automating a Roomba with ESPHome</title>

      <description>When I first bought this wifi-connected Roomba, I knew that someday it might have to join the Internet of Shit.
The iRobot corporation has a pretty good track record for supporting their products, but at some point those servers are going to come down, or the app will break, or the SSL certificates will expire, etc.
These products need continuous support from their companies in order to operate, and products simply cannot be supported forever.</description>
